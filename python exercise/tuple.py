# Tuple is a list of value grouped together.
value = (2,4,5,6)
print(value[1])


# the only difference between list and tuple are all the values in the list have similar meaning but in tuple all the value have different meaning.
# tuples are immutable i.e its value cannot be changed. but list are mutable.

# value[2] = 4 it gives error.
